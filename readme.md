Project Report Explanation: Simple Java-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

Project Title:
Simple Port Monitoring Intrusion Detection System Using Java

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in Java that continuously monitors specific TCP ports on a target system. It helps to detect unauthorized port access which may indicate potential intrusions or attacks.

Project Concept:
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors a system or network to identify suspicious activities.
In this project, the IDS:

Repeatedly scans well-known ports on a target IP address.

Alerts the user if any of the monitored ports are found to be open.

Runs continuously to provide real-time monitoring.

This is a simple simulation of IDS behavior focused on port-based monitoring.

Working Principle:
The program uses Java Sockets to attempt a connection to selected ports (like 21, 22, 23, 80, 443).

If a port is open, the socket connection succeeds and an alert is generated.

If a port is closed, a timeout or connection failure occurs, indicating no active service.

The IDS repeatedly scans at regular intervals (every 5 seconds) for real-time updates.

Key Components:
Socket Programming:
Used to attempt a connection to a specific IP and port.

Port List:
Predefined list of ports commonly targeted by attackers (e.g., 21 for FTP, 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP).

Alert System:
Displays an alert message if any monitored port is open.

Infinite Loop with Delay:
Runs continuously, checking ports at regular intervals using Thread.sleep().

Advantages of this IDS:
Simple and easy to implement.

Works without any external libraries.

Real-time basic intrusion monitoring.

Helps users to track potential unauthorized access to sensitive ports.

Limitations:
Can only monitor open ports; does not analyze packet contents.

Not a full-featured IDS (no deep packet inspection).

Cannot detect complex attack patterns.

Only useful for small-scale or demonstration purposes.

Possible Enhancements:
Integrate with email/SMS alerting systems.

Expand to monitor multiple IP addresses.

Upgrade to full packet analysis using libraries like Jpcap or Pcap4j.

Build a GUI dashboard for visualization.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the basic concept of intrusion detection using Java port monitoring.
It provides a foundational understanding of how port-based intrusion detection works and can serve as a starting point for building more advanced IDS tools.
